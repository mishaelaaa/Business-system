# Scaning with camera
We will use Nikon dslr as well as their image scanning software. The assigned task is to take certain identifying numbers after scanning a machine drawing. Then, you view an organization in the business structure.

# QR code generator
After it is understood which machine this drawing belongs to, a QR Code shows on which row and column all the information about this machine is located.
